  Current implementation for EASE testing

  Authentication is done with Basic Authentication method. This method
  requires to pass special 

  **Authorization** header with each HTTP request:

  ```text
  Authorization: Basic <BASE64>
  ```

  `<BASE64>` is the Base64 encoded "username:password" string.

  There are a few assumptions with this approach

  1. username and password must literally equal to each other

  2. username validity is not being checked in the system (authorization
  engine grants access for any passed username), so any random string can be
  used as username.

  So for client with `BLOCKHENGE:BLOCKHENGE` credentials the header will look
  like:

  ```
  Authorization: Basic QkxPQ0tIRU5HRTpCTE9DS0hFTkdF
  ```
